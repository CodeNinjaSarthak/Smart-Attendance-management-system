# Smart-Attendance-management-system

Designed and developed a Smart Attendance Management System that automates the process of recording attendance using QR codes. The system integrates Flask as the backend framework and Tkinter for the GUI. The project leverages a QR code-based scanning system, which is paired with a local hotspot server to efficiently capture and store attendance data. The system operates on a local host to ensure real-time processing and secure data handling, streamlining the attendance process for educational and professional institutions.
